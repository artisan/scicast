# SciCast Competition Management System

This is a Ruby on Rails + [Hobo][1] web application for managing the [SciCast](http://www.planet-scicast.com) competition.

The app was built by [Artisan Technology][2] and [StoryCog][3], funded by [NESTA][4].

NESTA have generously asked that the software be contributed to the open-source community. The software is valuable on two counts:

 - As the starting point for a competition management system that can support a wide variety of online competitions. The details of the operations of the SciCast competition are not hard-wired, and the software can be customised relatively easy to be used in many other ways. In particular the software features a very free-form and flexible editorial system. 

 - As a complete example of a web app built using the Hobo extensions to Ruby on Rails, and as such a valuable resource to learners of Hobo.
